## 1. Description of the problem
```
Website phishing is a form of cyberattack where malicious actors create a fraudulent website that mimics a legitimate one. The goal is to deceive users into revealing sensitive information, such as:
Login credentials,Credit card details, Personal identification data (e.g., Social Security numbers), Account details for financial systems

These fake websites often closely resemble the appearance and URL of a trusted site, making it difficult for users to distinguish between the legitimate and malicious versions.

Techniques Used in Website Phishing
Spoofed URLs: Cybercriminals use URLs similar to legitimate websites (e.g., using "g00gle.com" instead of "google.com").
Email Phishing: Victims are lured through emails containing links to the phishing site.
Clone Websites: Replicas of legitimate websites with subtle differences.
SSL Certificates: Phishing sites might also use HTTPS to appear more authentic.
Pop-up Forms:Fake login or payment forms embedded in legitimate-looking sites.

How Website Phishing Affects Online Trading
Online trading platforms, such as stock brokerages, cryptocurrency exchanges, and e-commerce websites, are frequent targets of phishing attacks. The impact includes:
1. Loss of Sensitive Information
2. Theft of Funds
3. Compromised Reputation
4. Fraudulent Trades and Market Manipulation
5. Identity Theft
6. Loss of Business Opportunities


The goal is to use set collected features to predict phishing websites and avoid/minize losses.

Docker file: to create docker image
```

## Instructions on how to run the project
```
1- create the env as in (2)
2- activate the environment
   conda activate ml-zoomcamp
3- run flask backend service
    waitress-serve --port=9696 app:app
4- Run predict test, open new cmd window , activate the env
   conda activate ml-zoomcamp
   python test_service.py
```

### Build and run through Docker
